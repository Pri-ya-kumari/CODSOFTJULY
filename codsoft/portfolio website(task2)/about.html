                    <p class="p7">Hi I'm a Frontend Web Developer building the Front-end of Websites that leads to the success of the overall product. 
                                  Check out some of my work in the Projects section.</p>
                    <p class="p8">Iâ€™ve just graduated from computer science. Looking for my first job, I decided to go with web development, 
                                  since I understand that it is impossible to succeed in almost any business without some online presence. 
                                  Hence I know the opportunities are there and will stay there. I specialize in creating websites and web 
                                  applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In my spare time, I enjoy reading, spending time with my family, 
                                  and watching series </p>
                    <p class="p9">I'm open to Job opportunities where I can contribute, learn and grow. If you have a good opportunity that matches 
                                  my skills and experience then don't hesitate to contact me. </p>
